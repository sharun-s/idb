development.","14.1: By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular 
from land- based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.",14.1.1: Coastal Water Quality Index(CWQI),"The CWQI which is calculated for each monitoring location can be used to assess the heath 
of the coastal waters. Based on the CWQI, the monitoring locations can be categorized as 
Poor, Fair, Good etc. Range for coastal water quality is as follows: 
(i) 0-20 --- Very Poor, 
(ii) 21-40 --- Poor, 
(iii) 41-60 -- Moderate, 
(iv) 61-80 --- Good, 
(v) 81-100 --- Very Good.

angrove cover is defined as ‘Area covered under mangrove vegetation as interpreted 
from remote sensing data. It is included in the forest cover’. 
orest cover is defined as ‘All Lands, more than 1 hectare in area, with a tree canopy 
density of more than 10% irrespective of ownership and legal status. Such land may not 
necessarily be a recorded forest area. It also includes orchards, bamboo and palm’. 
angrove cover assessment is carried out biennially and changes thereon with respect to 
the previous assessment are calculated for each district, States and country. 
orest cover assessment is a biennial wall to wall mapping exercise based on Remote 
sensing using LISS III (23.5 mtr Resolution) sensor data from IRS P6, supported by inten-
sive ground verification and field data from National Forest Inventory. Area covered under 
mangrove vegetation is also included in the forest cover. 
angrove shows conspicuous tone and textures on the satellite images, which has been 
used in the mapping of mangrove cover of the country. 
hanges in forest cover under mangrove w.r.t to previous assessments are calculated for 
district, State and country level. Based on the analysis of changes observed w.r.t previous 
assessment, a change matrix is generated indicating the change in the extent of mangrove 
cover.","Forest Survey of India, Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change",2015 over 2013,2 years,In percentage,2017 over 2015,"http://fsi.nic.in

(CMLRE) and National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) is monitoring the estuarine, 
coastal and open ocean pH to ascertain the status of Ocean Acidification being influenced 
by anthropogenic activities and climate change conditions. NCCR through its “Seawater 
Quality Monitoring (SWQM / COMAPS)” programme is monitoring pH of the estuaries and 
coastal seas of India since 1990s. Apart CMLRE & NCCR are jointly monitoring coastal and 
oceanic pH of the eastern Arabian Sea including on its shelf. 
Decrease in pH over a long-term period indicates the Ocean Acidification.",Ministry of Earth Science,2019,-,Number of sites,2019,NA

Maximum sustainable yield is computed as Potential Yield Estimation (PYE) in Exclusive 
Economic Zone. PYE is calculated by two approaches 
(i) Trophodynamic approach 
(ii) Direct estimation from fish landing and fish survey data. 
ish groups which are included in potential yield estimation are phytoplanktivores, pelagic 
planktivores, pelagic carnivores, pelagic omnivores, Benthic carnivores and Miscellaneous 
fish.","Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries",2015-17,,Number,2018,NA

Reinforced Plastic (FRP) Boats for 10 coastal States. The main objective is to organize 
all the traditional fishermen who are engaged in deep sea fishing operations and to 
engage in the protection of coastal environment, conservation of marine ecosystems 
and preservation of natural resources. This assistance also provides access for fishing 
equipment at reasonable cost.","Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries",2016-17,Annual,"Number, Rs. in Lakhs",2018-19,NA
