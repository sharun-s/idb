The indicator is based on the number of industries in each category complying for the 
environmental norms specific to that type of industrial sector. 
The 17 categories of highly polluting industries are those which may emit harmful gases. 
The categories of such industries include fertiliser, chlor-alkali, pesticide, pharmaceutical, 
petroleum oil refinery, integrated iron and steel plant and copper and zinc smelting units. 
rossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) 
• Industry discharging pollution load of BOD 100kg per day and/or handling hazardous 
chemicals as specified in manufacturing, Import, Storage of Hazardous Chemical Rules, 
1989 and as amended; 
• GPIs were identified as industries discharging effluent into water course and a) handling 
harardous substance, or b) effluent having BOD load of 100 Kg per day or more, or c) a 
combination of (a) and (b) 
ndustries which are having pollution index of 60 and above, on scorecard of 0-100 in 
terms of increasing pollution are Red category industries. Industries falling under ‘Red’ 
category will not be permitted in ecologically fragile or sensitive areas. Interestingly, indus-
tries like integrated automobile manufacturing, airports and commercial air strips, and milk 
& dairy products are included in the ‘Red’ category.
