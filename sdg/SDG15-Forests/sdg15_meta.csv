rotected areas are those in which human occupation or at least the exploitation of 
resources is limited.. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level 
of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of 
the international organizations involved. The term “protected area” also includes 
Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and 
Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders 
inside the area for conservation and economic purposes.","Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change",2015,2 Years,Percentage (in ‘000 sq.km.),2019,http://wiienvis.nic.in/Database/Protected_Area_854.aspx

The ‘Forest Area’ or ‘Recorded Forest Area (RFA)’ refers to all the geographic areas 
recorded as ‘Forests’ in government records. RFA mainly consists of Reserved Forests (RF) 
and Protected Forests (PF), which have been notified under the provisions of Indian Forest 
Act, 1927 or its counterpart State Acts. Besides RFs & PFs, the RFA may also include all 
such areas, which have been recorded as forests in the revenue records or have been 
constituted so under any State Act or Local Laws. The data for this indicator is collected by

Forest cover is defined as ‘All Lands, more than 1 hectare in area, with a tree canopy 
density of more than 10% irrespective of ownership and legal status. Such land may not 
necessarily be a recorded forest area. It also includes orchards, bamboo and palm’. 
ountain areas include hill districts wherein more than 50% of its geographical area 
under ‘hill talukas’ based on criteria adopted by the planning commission for hill area and 
Western Ghats development programmes. About 127 hill districts have been taken into 
consideration for forest cover analysis in India State of Forest Report 2017. 
orest cover assessment in 127 hill districts is carried out biennially and changes thereon 
with respect to the previous assessment are calculated for each district, States and 
country. 
orest cover assessment is a biennial wall to wall mapping exercise based on Remote 
sensing using LISS III (23.5 mtr Resolution) sensor data from IRS P6, supported by 
intensive ground verification and field data from National Forest Inventory.
