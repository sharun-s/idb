Generate 4 things from the main sdg pdf
* meta data about each metric - stored sdg1_meta.csv sdg2_meta.csv etc
* state level data - see sdg1 directory south_summary.csv 
* national totals - stored as national_sdg1.csv etc
* graphs for each metric auto generated from metadata + state/group of states

1. Gets tables from pdf save as csv. 

In example start extraction from page 320

python3 getFromtabl.py data/SDGProgressReport2020.pdf 320 1

Will ask user to specify simpler file name 

eg: For Indicator 16.9.2 first few lines of table are printed like below. 
                   0     1     2     3
1           State/ut  2015  2016  2017
2     Andhra Pradesh  98.4  95.7  96.5
3  Arunachal Pradesh   100   100   100
Proportion of population covered under Aadhaar
(in percentage)
Desc: Indicator1692 Suffix:AadharCoverage

At suffix prompt here AadharCoverage is specified and file created is
Indicator1692_AadharCoverage.csv. Then next table is extracted.

Ctrl+C to stop processing. 

2. Get only reqd data 
# rename all files removing unnecessary Indicator string
rename -e 's/Indicator//' *.csv
#dump required states
egrep "Tamil|Karna|Keral|Andhra|Telan" *.csv >south_summary.csv

3. Get Meta info - used in add details to graph
python3 getMetatabls.py data/SDGProgressReport2020.pdf '112-121' 1 sdg1_meta.csv
python3 getMetatabls.py data/SDGProgressReport2020.pdf '122-130' 1 sdg2_meta.csv

4. right now sdg1 dir has a dummy pseudo python script based on southsummary.csv and sdg1_meta.csv that autogenerates graph

python3 csv2g.py 

5. national.csv has national totals
this is just documenting how it was produced
python3 -c "import pandas as p;import camelot;t=camelot.read_pdf(r'data/SDGProgressReport2020.pdf',pages='pg1-pgN');df=p.concat([i.df for i in t]);df.to_csv('national.csv',index=False)

To generate a specific metric -
sed -n -e '/^Goal 3/,/^Goal 4/{ /^Goal 4/d; p;}' national.csv > national_sdg3.csv

(hack - this will fail if goal has commas in which case the whole line is quoted so do
sed -n -e '/^"Goal 16/,/^"Goal 17/{ /^"Goal 17/d; p;}' national.csv > national_sdg16.csv

then open file remove quotes and delete commas in title 
until main script is done which is never.
)

6. parse_national.py - takes the csv file abv and convert into json (to be used in graph gen where national totals need to be depicted)
script will fail if lines are split, commas missing, extra commas etc etc. Manually fix and rerun

***NOTE creating hierarchical json was simpler with parse_national than doing it through refine or pandas

MISC
print 3rd col of csv example sdg8_meta.csv
python3 -c "import pandas as p;p.set_option('max_colwidth', -1);d=p.read_csv('sdg8_meta.csv');print(d.iloc[:,[2]].to_string(index=False))"
