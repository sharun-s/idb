			Hello and thanks for visiting! I am a <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/sharunsanthosh">techie</a> based in Chennai, India. This project stems out of my interest in the Semantic web, NLP, Datamining and Interactive Visualization. I work on it in my freetime.
			So there are lots of things broken or waiting to break. All intentional ofcourse ;)
			</p>
			<p style='margin-top:2%;margin-right:5%;margin-left:5%;font-family:calibri,tahoma,arial,sans-serif;'>
			The project has been set up to mainly to kick around ideas, and share info and resources with like minded folk. Feedback (good, bad and ugly) can be sent to <span style="color:#3399ff">sharun@imine.in</span>
			</p>
			<p style='margin-top:2%;margin-right:5%;margin-left:5%;font-size:16px;'>
			Some background...this experiment started sometime in 2007 with me stumbling across <a href="http://thehindu.com/">The Hindu's</a> jobs archive. They had all their job ads archived since 2001
			(been taken down since). It was a pretty amazing resource, if completely unused and negelected.
			At the time it didn't take long to download the entire thing and start ploting out and examining interesting trends.
			</p>
			<p style='margin-top:2%;margin-right:5%;margin-left:5%;font-size:16px;'>
			This got me wondering about what else I could find. It lead me to the excellent <a href="http://www.nltk.org">NLP toolkit</a>, which introduced me to the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing.
			I soon found a bunch of sites like Barney Pell's Powerset blog (Powerset is the tech behind Microsoft's Bing search engine and uses a lot of NLP), Freebase, Twine, DBpedia, IBM's Manyeyes, sense.us and the list went on and on and I was hooked.
			</p>
			<p style='margin-top:2%;margin-right:5%;margin-left:5%;font-size:16px;'>Not only are the tools getting powerful and easy to use, the amount of interesting data available has exploded. It's a great time to be mining data.
			</p>

			<p style='margin-top:2%;margin-right:5%;margin-left:5%;font-size:16px;'>
			My focus is going to be on <b>small</b> sets of structured data, examples being the <b>local</b> classifieds(list of jobs, list of rentals, list of personal ads), a list of youtube movies, travel guides, a topical twitter stream etc. Local and small being the keywords. Keep your eyes open and you will see a lot these small dataset all around that are perfect for exploration tools.
			</p>
			<p style='margin-top:2%;margin-right:5%;margin-left:5%;font-size:16px;'>Why <b>small</b>? The larger the dataset the more you need to know to understand it. You dont see too many experts in everything, do you? There really aren't any.</p>

			<p style='margin-top:2%;margin-right:5%;margin-left:5%;font-size:16px;'>Understanding context is a very important aspect of extracting useful info.
			The greater the ambiguity the more complex it gets to understand things. What does 65 represent? age, height, weight, door number...<b>context</b> answers that.</p>

			<p style='margin-top:2%;margin-right:5%;margin-left:5%;font-size:16px;'>
			If the dataset is <b>local</b> to a town the number of things needed to be known is smaller.
			Small datasets are also easy to visualize and therefore easier for people to navigate and understand.
			But there are lots of interesting small datasets out there that are still presented in a very outdated fashion. A lot more can be done, in terms of tools and tech to expose that hidden value.
